# jenkins-backup-restore-script

a python script on a remote server using Jenkins and have a backup and restore function

Set up a Jenkins job for the python script. To do this, go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on "New Item". Give the job a name and select "Freestyle project" as the project type.

In the "Build" section, add a new build step and select "Execute shell" as the type. In the command section, write the following command to run the python script on the remote server:

"python3.8 [Jenkins_job_workspace]/python_script.py backup" to backup 

"python3.8 [Jenkins_job_workspace]//python_script.py restore" to restore

Save the job and run it to test the backup and restore function. If the script runs successfully and the backup and restore steps are executed, you should see the backup and restored versions of the python script in the backup folder.

Note: This is just one way to run a python script on a remote server using Jenkins and add a backup and restore function. There are many other ways to do this, and you may need to adjust the steps depending on your specific setup.
